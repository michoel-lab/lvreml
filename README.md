# lvreml

## Introduction

**lvreml** implements a restricted maximum-likelihood method for learning latent variance components in gene expression data. The method is fully described in the paper:

[MA Malik](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Muhammad.Ammar.Malik) and [T Michoel](https://lab.michoel.info). *Restricted maximum-likelihood method for learning latent variance components in gene expression data with known and unknown confounders.*

A copy of the paper and supplementary information is also available in the [paper](./paper/) directory of this repository.

**lvreml** is available for Matlab and Python.

## Installation

### Matlab

Add the directory containing the m-files ([./m/](./m/)) to the Matlab search path: if you cloned or downloaded the repository to a directory **/some_path/lvreml/**, then issue the command

```matlab
>> addpath(/some_path/lvreml/m)
```

on the matlab command line.

### Python

## Usage

### Package content

Both the Matlab and Python versions contain the same functions:

* **data_prep**
* **initial_screen**
* **loglike**
* **lvreml**

#### data_prep

#### initial_screen
